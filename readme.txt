This folder demonstrates calculations and shows results for the manuscript "The three regimes of spatial recovery".

The scripts to use are Named Fig1 - Fig7, following the manuscript itself. 
Besides Matlab, you need to download the library RDM at:
https://github.com/yzelnik/RDM

After that, you "install" the library by running the script: setrdmpath.m

You can then open each script separately, and run it in several steps, by clicking each section (shown in yellow) and using Ctrl+Enter to run each section consecutively.
Depending on the script, and change of parameters, some of the scripts can take a few minutes or more to run.
